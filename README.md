## About
Simple Jupyter notebooks which are intended to boost an _anime-otaku's_ daily productivity. (Can be used by Non-otakus as well. ^.^ )

## Documentation
Look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/hyPnOtICDo0g/Otakulab/wiki), B-Baka! (>_<)/

## Roadmap

If you want to see a new feature, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/hyPnOtICDo0g/Otakulab/issues). Here are some notebook(s) that I plan to develop sometime soon.

* Fansub-utils: This is aimed to do quick operations on the media files stored on your google drive. Features planned are as follows:

    * Basic ffmpeg & mkvtoolnix usage, which includes muxing, audio encoding, dub purging & frame (screenshot), subtitles, fonts & chapters extraction.
    * CRC32 check.
    * `mediainfo` for the files stored on google drive.
> Note: These features still don't require a GPU runtime.
